### Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using data extracted from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS) from Kaggle to better understand the following questions:

##### Question 1: 
What was the most frequently reported food for allergies and what was the resulting outcome?
##### Question 2: 
What was the most reported food allergies symptom?
##### Question 3: 
What foods result in death for ‘elderly’ vs. the same reactions for ‘young people’?


### File Descriptions
Files I used for this project are shown below:

| File | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Food Allergy Analysis .ipynb | Jupyter Notebook with all the exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased |
| Food Allergy Analysis.html  | HTML format of the Jupyter notebook data |
| CAERS_ASCII_2004_2017Q2.csv | Raw data from the Adverse Event Reporting System in CSV format |
| CAERS_README.pdf | CAERS readme file for its dataset |

### Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the attached jupyter notebook.

### Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Must give credit to Kaggle for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/fda/adverse-food-events). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here.
